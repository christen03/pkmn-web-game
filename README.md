## Welcome!

For those of you who didn't already know, Pokémon played a huge part in my life growing up. I made tons of friends through our common love for the game and spent maybe a little too much money collecting the cards and playing the games. In the end though, it was all worth it. All the memories and laughs we shared because of the game still make me smile today.

So I'm building a little Pokémon like game that can be played right in your web browser! I thought it would also be a nice way to work on my JavaScript. It's definitely a work in progress, but I plan to work on it whenever I'm not crushed by schoolwork. Feel free to revisit from time to time! 

Thanks for stopping by! :)
